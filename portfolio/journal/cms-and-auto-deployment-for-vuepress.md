# Content management and auto deployment for VuePress

Let's check out how we can manage the content from within Forestry and automatically deploy our VuePress site.

## Manage your content with Forestry

This theme is pre-configured and works out of the box with Forestry. Create an account at [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry") and import your repository. You can now edit, manage and preview your content.

That's it, that's all. Enjoy your new site!![](/upload/photo-1504198322253-cfa87a0ff25f.jpeg)

## Deployment

1. Create a new site in [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and import your repository.
2. Set the build command to: `npm run build`
3. Set the publish directory to `portfolio/.vuepress/dist`
